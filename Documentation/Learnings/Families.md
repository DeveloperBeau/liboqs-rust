# Algorithm families

## A liboqs fact can differ between the parameter sets of a family

- Trap: a port that writes one version text for a family differs from the C library for one parameter set.
- Finding: `eachRegisteredMechanismHasTheFactsOfTheCMechanism` failed for `Kyber512`. liboqs names commit `74cad307` of the reference code as its version, and commit `28413dfb` for `Kyber768` and `Kyber1024`.
- Rule: each parameter set takes each of its facts from the C file of that set, `kem_<name>.c` or `sig_<name>.c`, and the coverage test compares the whole description.

## Two families with the same arithmetic can draw their random bytes differently

- Trap: a key pair that draws its 64 bytes in one request gives other keys than the C code, which draws them in two.
- Finding: ML-KEM draws `d || z` in one request of 64 bytes. Kyber draws `d` and later `z` in two requests of 32 bytes, so the NIST DRBG gives other bytes for `z`.
- Rule: the port of a family copies the order and the sizes of the random requests of its C code, and the known-answer test of each set proves them.

## A debug test build is slow for cryptography

- Trap: the test suite of a family takes ten times longer than it needs to.
- Finding: the ML-KEM tests took 10 seconds at the optimization level 0 and 1.3 seconds at level 1.
- Rule: the workspace builds `dev` with `opt-level = 1`. The overflow checks and the debug assertions stay on, so an overflow that the C code does not have still fails a test.

## A rejection test that changes one byte cannot see an exclusive or

- Trap: the comparison of the re-encryption with the ciphertext folds the byte differences with an or. A fold with an exclusive or passes every test that changes one byte.
- Finding: mutation testing replaced the or with `^` in the decapsulation of ML-KEM and of Kyber, and every test still passed. When two bytes differ by the same value, the exclusive or gives zero, and the mechanism accepts the changed ciphertext.
- Rule: the rejection tests of a family also change the same bit in two bytes, so that the two differences cancel under an exclusive or. `aCiphertextWithTheSameBitChangedInTwoBytesIsRejected` is the template.
